# Welcome to #Co-MASK

We invite you to join a global maker project to create fabric masks and promote hope, humanity, and hygiene practices in time of crisis. We want to raise awareness about the risks of COVID-19 infection and the need for physical distancing, and promote solidarity. **Kiss and smile at a safe distance!**

The project offers instructions in many languages how to make masks in individual sizes. All you need are materials you will likely find at home: cotton T-shirt and kitchen cloth, and non-woven fabric. You do not need a sowing machine; scissors, thread, and needle will be enough. The masks are washable, have a nose clip, and allow for inserting a replaceable filter such as a surgical mask. **While the Co-MASK cannot prevent an infection with the Coronavirus, it offers some protection from larger droplets and prevents you from touching your face**. We are currently translating the mask instructions into many languages, you are welcome to help. We hope to inspire you to create these masks for your family, friends, and your community. Please wash the masks before disseminating and be careful to distribute them without physical contact. 

Create your own mask with kiss and smile, post on social media with hashtag **#Co-MASK**
