Welcome to #Co-MASK

Co-MASK is a global co-creation project aimed at a wide-spread production and dissemination of DIY fabric masks to support our community at the time of crisis. The masks promote hope, humanity, and hygiene practices. Rather than erasing our personality and facial expression, the Co-MASK is aimed at raising awareness about the risks of infection and the need for physical distancing, while promoting social solidarity. Creative collaboration across borders allow for expression of our diverse and fluid identities, bringing us closer together as global citizens at the time of physical distancing and struggle for survival. 

The project offers sewing instructions for the face masks in personalized sizes, using 3 layers of fabric available at home: cotton T-shirt and kitchen cloth, and non-woven fabric. They are washable, have a nose clip, and allow for inserting a surgical mask and/or a replaceable filter. While the Co-MASK cannot prevent an infection with the Coronavirus, it does provide some protection from larger droplets and by preventing you from touching your face. The mask instructions can be replicated in any location, in any language. We hope to inspire you to create these masks for your community, making them available for free and through a no-contact pick up. DIY instructions for replication are made available for everyone in various languages, so anyone with or without a sewing machine can multiply the effort.
